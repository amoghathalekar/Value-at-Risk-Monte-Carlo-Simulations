# Value-at-Risk-Monte-Carlo-Simulations

There are two files in this repositiory. One uses the Parametric method for calculation of VaR. The other uses the Bootstrapping method for the simulations.

Drawback of Parametric method: Assumes normality of returns.

Advantage of Bootstrapping method with historical data: DOES NOT ASSUME NORMALITY of Returns.
